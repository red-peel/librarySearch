# Bookstore Search!

Good day! The project you are about to see is something that I would like to further develop in the future for my mother who aspires to own a bookstore one day.

This program allows you to skim through a json file with 100 books as well as construct your own simply by using the console. All of the data will be loaded to an ArrayList collection structure in Java. 

In addition to searching, you are also to add an additional piece of media on your own! 

You are be able to filter by title, year created, author, country of origin and more. You can also find an individual book and look at all the information that the json file provides. 

Thank you for your time.

You can view the link to the repository where this code is stored here at [GitHub](https://github.com/red-peel/librarySearch)

**NOTE:**

**The information in the JSON file has some bugs. Parsing characters from different languages did not play well with something. This is not a bug in the program, just some weird characters in the JSON file. This can be fixed through editing the JSON but I felt unescessary doing so as it does not change the fact that the program works.**

<sup><sub>I also did not feel like going through the 100 books and editing out errors. </sup></sub>
